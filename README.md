# Space-Signal-Image-Classification
A CNN made from scratch which classifies images of  2D spectograms of deep space radio signals collected by Allen Telescope Array  at the SETI institute.

Used Keras with Tensorflow at its backend.

Treated the spectrograms as images to train an image classification model to classify the signals into one of four classes :- [squiggle , narrowband, narrowbandrd , noise].

This is a beginner's project and you can use it to learn the basics of Keras and CNN.
